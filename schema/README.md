# AGNTCY Observability Data Schema

## Introduction

This document describes the AGNTCY Observability Data Schema, an extension of the Open Telemetry (OTel) framework, following the LLM Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems.  This schema is designed to provide comprehensive observability for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), enabling detailed monitoring, analysis, and evaluation of their performance and behavior.

AGNTGY.org is releasing this schema to facilitate standardized observability across diverse agentic systems. It is enriched with MAS-specific concepts, such as agent collaboration success rate, MAS response time, and task delegation accuracy.

## Goal

The primary goal of this schema is to provide a standardized structure for Observability SDKs to implement, ensuring consistent data capture and reporting across diverse agentic systems implemented in various frameworks.

## Key Components of the Schema

The AGNTCY Observability Data Schema encompasses three primary data types: Metrics, Traces, and Events.

### 1. Metrics

Metrics are numerical measurements captured over time, providing insights into the performance and resource utilization of the system. The schema defines a set of metrics covering various aspects of Generative AI clients and servers.
