# Remote Agents with NATS

This repository demonstrates an agentic application that communicates with a remote agent with NATS pubsub. It has the following simple topology:

```bash
client.publish <-----> NATS-server <----> Server.subscribe
```

- Client contains a Langgraph application
- Server is a FastAPI application that contains the remote agent

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- A virtual environment is recommended for isolating dependencies.
- a `.env` at the proejct root with your OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agntcy/observe
   cd observe/examples/remote_agent_nats
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   set -a
   source .env
   set +a

   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv sync
   ```

   Optionally install observe-sdk from source:
   ```bash
   make install-dev
   ```

## Running the Application

### Nats and observability service stack

To run a nats server, otel collector, clickhouse-db, and grafana, use the provided `docker-compose.yaml`.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Server

You can run the server using the provided Makefile or running `app/server.py` directly.

   ```bash
   make run-server
   ```

### Client

You can run the client the provided Makefile or running `client/client_agent.py` directly.

   ```bash
   make run-client
   ```

### Output

On a successful run you should an output similar to the following:

- client:

```bash
