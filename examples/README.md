# üß† IOA Observe Examples

This repository contains example scripts showcasing how to use agents, tools, and workflows with:

- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
- [`ioa_observe` SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ioa-observe-sdk/) for observability and tracing

These examples are designed to help you understand how to build, trace, and debug multi-agent systems.

---

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt.txt
```

> **Note:** Some examples may require additional dependencies ‚Äî check the import statements in each script.

---

## üîß Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables before running the examples:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
export OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT=<your_otel_exporter_endpoint>
export TAVILY_API_KEY=<your_tavily_api_key>  # Optional, for web search tool used in langgraph example
```

---

### üöÄ How to Run

After installing the dependencies and setting environment variables, run an example with:

```bash
python <filename.py>
```
